# Backend Task

Welcome to Easel AI's Backend / Fullstack Engineering Task. 

Since we're still a very young company, we would like you to showcase how to bring up some very fundamentla services from scratch. 

Concretely, we would like you to create a CI/CD pipeline for IOS development. To do this please complete the following steps:

1. Fork this repo into you own GitHub accound so that you can access the necessary features.
2. Create an example iPhone project, and implement some tests for the code. 

### The pipeline should support the following features upon pushing a new commit to the github repository.:*

- Run linter on the project code and report any linting errors
- Verify that the project file compiles and report any errors
- Run tests implemented in the project, and report any failed tests.

### Bonus features
- upload result of successful build to Appstore Connect
- implement a hook that posts a Slack message about the successful upload 

Use any tooling that you believe will best accomplish the job.
